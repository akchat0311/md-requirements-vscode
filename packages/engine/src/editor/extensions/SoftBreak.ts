/**
 * Soft line break — a markdown "lazy wrap" (`\n` inside a paragraph).
 *
 * Raw `\n` inside ProseMirror text nodes is hazardous in real Chromium:
 * contentEditable rewrites the newlines into `<br>` elements while executing
 * ordinary edits elsewhere in the paragraph, and the DOM re-read then maps
 * those through HardBreak's `br` rule — silently turning soft wraps into
 * hard breaks (serialized as trailing `\`). Verified in a Playwright repro
 * against the built webview bundle (2026-08-30).
 *
 * SoftBreak eliminates raw `\n` from the editable DOM: the webview expands
 * text newlines into these nodes after parsing (expandSoftBreaks) and
 * collapses them back to `\n` before serializing (collapseSoftBreaks).
 * The tagged `<br data-soft-break>` wins over HardBreak's plain `br` rule
 * via priority, so DOM re-reads are lossless.
